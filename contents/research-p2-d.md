Through mechanistic TK modeling, we found:

- Copper (Cu):

  With increasing salinity, the water uptake rate $k_{\mathrm{u}}$ decreases, while the sediment uptake rate $k_{\mathrm{f}}$ increases, resulting in a net increase in overall Cu accumulation.


- Nickel (Ni):

  As salinity increases, both the uptake rate of Ni from the water and from the sediment decrease, leading to a net decrease in overall Ni accumulation.
