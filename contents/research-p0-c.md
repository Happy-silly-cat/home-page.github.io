Unlike traditional toxicity tests—which provide only static endpoints (LC50 or EC50)—TKTD models:

- incorporate time-dependent exposure and hazard,
- reduce reliance on long and costly chronic toxicity tests,
- and can extrapolate short-term data to predict long-term biological effects.

The successful applications of the model in sediments can be found in the Publication below.
