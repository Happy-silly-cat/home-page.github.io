### **Sediment** Toxicokinetic–Toxicodynamic Model

A sediment TKTD model describes:

- Toxicokinetics (TK):

  How metals are taken up, eliminated, accumulated in organisms over time.

- Toxicodynamics (TD):

  How accumulated metals cause damage, affect survival, and lead to toxicity.

Key parameters include $k_{\mathrm{u}}$ and $k_{\mathrm{f}}$ representing uptake rates, $k_{\mathrm{e}}$ representing elimination rate, and $S(t)$ representing survival rate.
