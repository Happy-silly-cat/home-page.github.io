the bioaccumulation rate is quantitatively defined as the difference between the uptake rate and the elimination rate. The influence of environmental factors on bioaccumulation is reflected by the variation of model parameters. **<u>To accurately determine these parameters, we employed isotope tracing techniques</u>**, using different isotopes to clearly distinguish between the uptake and elimination processes.
