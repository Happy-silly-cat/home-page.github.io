Bioaccumulation depends on the balance between uptake and elimination, and salinity changes can shift this balance in complex ways. This process can be explicitly resolved and interpreted through modeling. 

TK modeling, combined with a novel stable-isotope tracing technique, allows us to separate and quantify:

- uptake from water,
- uptake from sediments,
- and elimination over time.
