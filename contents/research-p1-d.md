Based on **<u>10-day sediment toxicity tests</u>** and **<u>10-day aqueous toxicity tests</u>**, we determined the parameters of the biodynamic model and subsequently predicted the long-term metal accumulation and toxicity (LC50) of organisms in sediment environments, allowing for a rapid estimation of the ACR values. This approach can also be applied to various pollutants.
