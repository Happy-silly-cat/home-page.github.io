### Brief

My research explores how metals behave, accumulate, and exert toxicity in aquatic systems, with a particular focus on sediments. I am especially interested in developing **<u>mechanistic toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TKTD) models</u>** that quantify the links between metal bioavailability, bioaccumulation, and organism-level effects. By capturing the underlying processes that drive toxicity, these models provide **<u>predictive tools for long-term ecological impacts</u>** and help inform **<u>environmental quality standards and risk assessment for contaminated sediments.</u>**
