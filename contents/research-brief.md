### Overview

My research focuses on the biogeochemical behavior, bioaccumulation, and toxicity of metals in aquatic environments, with a particular emphasis on contaminated sediments. To understand and predict these processes, I develop mechanistic toxicokinetic (TK) and toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TKTD) models that describe how metals move through sediment–organism systems and how they ultimately cause adverse effects. These process-based models enable:

- quantitative prediction of exposure and internal metal concentrations,
- prediction of time-dependent toxicity, including chronic effects that are difficult to assess experimentally,
- and improved risk assessment for metal-contaminated sediments under changing environmental conditions.
